# Overview

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. This project, a Weather Dashboard uses a third-party API to access weather data by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.  The Weather Dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The Weather Dashboard is simple to use.  The user inputs a city name and clicks the send button.  When fully functioning, current and future weather conditions for that city appear.  The data consists of city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index.  
The UV Index is color coded to indicate if conditions are favorable, moderate or severe.  
The future weather will present as a 5-day forecast that displays the date, and icon, temperature and humidity.  
A searched city name is added to a search history list.  Each city name will be “clickable” for searching  and the last search result will persist when the application is reloaded.
This application is my second JQuery application. The dashboard partially functions. Updates to the 5-day forecast and local storage will allow the application to be fully operational. 
Current and future weather forecasts are important to everyday life.  Daily people look to access that information to plan commutes, travel and activities.  The mobile-first feature of the Weather Dashboard makes it useful to users.  The current design is flat.  Aesthetic enhancements would be good improvements to the application.
